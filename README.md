# RustyRose - An Audio and Music Processing Library in Rust Based on Librosa 

The main goal of this project will be a re-implementation of the librosa library in Python in Rust. 

The goal will be to provide full coverage, rigorous testing, and experimental benchmarking of the performance. In addition, various other types of audio and signal processing will be implemented and different ways of interfacing the system and integrating it with other packages and software. This mega-project is more focused on implementation and programming languages. Compatibility through mir_eval and jams, MIREX task implementation 

### RESOURCES 

* [Librosa audio and music processing in Python](https://librosa.org/)
* [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)

### TOOLS
This project primarily uses the Rust language and its dependency manager Cargo. We may utilze existing Python tools from the librosa ecosystem where appropriate.

* *decide on libraries used, fft, audio, benchmarking, testing, reference implimentations*
* mir_eval, jams, MIREX

### DATASETS

*This project will use ___ including*
* *something here*

### ASSOCIATED LITERATURE
* *see bibliography for now ?*

### RELATED WORK
This project has librosa as the primary reference for implimentation of this project. Librosa is a widely adopted Python based MIR toolkit. *Other related systems include _____*

RustyRose will differ from these projects by focusing on:
* Rust as the implementation language
* Explicit correctness testing
* Comparative benchmarking against Python tools 
* Understanding MIR pipelines ar the system level
