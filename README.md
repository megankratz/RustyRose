# RustyRose - an audio and music processing library in Rust based on librosa 

The main goal of this project will be a re-implementation of the librosa library in Python in Rust. 
The goal will be to provide full coverage, rigorous testing, and experimental benchmarking of the performance. In addition, various other types of audio and signal processing will be implemented and different ways of interfacing the system and integrating it with other packages and software. This mega-project is more focused on implementation and programming languages. Compatibility through mir_eval and jams, MIREX task implementation
